# RECURSION
Recursion is a processs  where a function calls itserlf directly or indirectly

Steps to implement recursion
1. Define the *base case*. Identify the simplest case fir which the solution is knowm. THIS IS THE STOPPING CONDITION that prevents the functions from infinitely calling itself.
2. Define the *recursive case*. Defining the smaller version of the problem and breaking it down. Help you understand what the purpose of the function is.
3. Ensuring the recursion terminates. Sometimes the base case is not achieved
